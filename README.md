The stock prices for Apple and Procter & Gamble are from Yahoo Finance.  It is one year's worth of data.

## Results

The models predicted the increasing prices of the stocks.

The models were tested using only two stocks.  The model should be tested on more stocks.  

It would be interesting to see if there are any changes to the results if more than one year of stock prices is used.

The financial statements should also be analyzed.
